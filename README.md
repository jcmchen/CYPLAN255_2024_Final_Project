were introduced to study the spatial and temporial aspects of different districts.

## 1. Bike Sharing System (YouBike 2.0) in Taipei

The availability of bikes differs at different times and locations. Take the National Taiwan University (NTU)/Gongguan area as an example.
During daytime, the supply is high (bottom left image). However, the supply is low during peak hours and times other than daytime (bottom right image).

Heatmaps were intrudoced to visualize the density of bike stations. Given the high density of bike stations in the National Taiwan University (NTU)/Gongguan area
(bottom left image), the supply is still low in the whole area, showing red on the right bottom image.

Based on the historical data (December, 2023), the top 10 most used/busiest stations are all stations located at the exists of the Taipei Metro (MRT) stations.
Those stations are not always busy throughout the whole day. Three stations near National Taiwan University (NTU) has low supply at 8:29 AM due to the university
has its first class starting at 9:10 AM (bottom left image).

Taipei, the capital city of Taiwan, is divided into 12 administrative districts. These districts are: Zhongzheng, Datong, Zhongshan, Songshan, Daan, 
Wanhua, Xinyi, Shilin, Beitou, Neihu, Nangang, and Wenshan. Based on the population data (Jan, 2022), the figure below shows the number of stations does not align with the number of population.

## 2. Housing Price in Taipei (2012-2023)

88101 housing price information was collected from 2012-2023(Q1-Q4) from the Dept of Land Administration M. O. I., Taiwan.
Among all the districts, Daan district has the highest housing price consistently. Other districts then could be clustered into three pricing levels (dark blue,
light blue, and yellow-orangish).
